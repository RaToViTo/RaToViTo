# RaToViTo- Radiotoxicity Visualization Tool
RaToViTo is a tool designed to simulate the evolution of isotope inventories in radioactive waste over time using a decay-only simulation approach powered by the open-source code OpenMC. It calculates radiotoxicities based on dose conversion coefficients for different age groups and provides visualizations of the results. Below, you will find information about system requirements, installation instructions, tool features, and functionality.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Miniconda or Anaconda. Download and install Miniconda for your operating system: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main

## Installation

    1. Clone the RaToViTo repository to your desired location and navigate to the RaToViTo directory:
       git clone https://github.com/RaToViTo/RaToViTo
       cd RaToViTo

    2. Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
       conda env create -f environment.yml

    3. Activate the ratovito-env environment:
       conda activate ratovito-env

    4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
       jupyter notebook


## Tool Features

The tool consists of the project folder (RaToViTo), which includes two Jupyter notebooks (isotope-based simulation.ipynb and inventory-based simulation.ipynb) and four additional subfolders.

### Notebooks

There are two notebooks, both following the same general structure but differing in their computational approach:

Inventory-based simulation: Performs a single, comprehensive simulation of the radioactive decay of the entire isotope inventory of spent nuclear fuel. This approach is computationally less demanding but does not provide the same level of detail as the isotope-based simulation.

Isotope-based simulation: Conducts individual simulations for each isotope in the spent fuel inventory. This approach is necessary to explicitly track the daughter isotopes generated from specific parent isotopes (nuclides) due to natural decay. It enables the calculation of the radiotoxicity of the daughter isotopes present alongside their parent isotopes.


### Subfolders

Backend: Contains the code modules that are loaded into the individual cells of the notebooks. These modules have been externalized to keep the notebooks concise and organized.
Graphs: Stores the plots generated by the tool.
Resources: Includes the input data required for the simulations, such as fuel data, decay constants, and dose conversion coefficients. These are stored in editable and extendable Excel files. The SpentFuel_Data file can be expanded with additional worksheets, but the structure of each sheet must remain consistent. The same applies to the Dose coefficients file. This folder also contains the decay chain file. Additional decay chain files can be downloaded from https://openmc.org/.
Simulation results: Contains result folders named by date and simulation configuration. Each result folder includes:
